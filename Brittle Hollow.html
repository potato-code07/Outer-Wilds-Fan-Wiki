    Brittle Hollow is the third of six planets in the Outer Wilds' solar system. Befitting its name, the planet consists of a brittle, rocky crust, surrounding a hollow interior with a large Black Hole serving as the planet's core. Regular bombardments from the planet's moon cause fragments of the fragile crust to break over the course of the loop, falling into the black hole core.
    <br><br>
    The planet is home to numerous Nomai structures scattered both on and under the planet's crust, including the enormous Hanging City, the Tower of Quantum Knowledge, the Southern Observatory, a Gravity Cannon, and the Black Hole Forge used by the Nomai to craft the warp cores for the Ash Twin Project.

        Brittle Hollow is a highly unstable planet that formed naturally around the black hole at its center. Its dry, rocky, purple-ish and slightly protruding surface is fractured and prone to collapse, and in each 22-minute cycle of game time, the player can observe as most of the planet's crust breaks away and falls into the black hole. These pieces then emerge at the White Hole next to the White Hole Station. This collapse is precipitated by the balls of lava ejected from the planet's moon, which rain down steadily and crash into Brittle Hollow's surface.
