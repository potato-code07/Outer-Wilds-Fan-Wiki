            <h2>Survival Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Despite the name, this section serves as a reminder of what not to do while you're in space. Like really, just don't do it. 
            </p>

            <h1>Death</h1>
            <p class="intro">
                Death is inevitable in Outer Wilds. When the player dies, images of their last life flash before their eyes, from their death to the start of them waking up in the Village, where they then respawn.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player is almost always bound to die at the latest 22 minutes after waking up, as the supernova explodes. The supernova may be outrun by flying far enough from the inner solar system, which technically allows the player to survive, but this will not prevent their memories from being sent back in time and thus the start of a new loop. Most of the time, the player will die before that, as the exploration of the solar system can result in many unplanned deaths through various means.
                Dying less than 60 seconds after waking up grants an Achievement.
            </p>

        </p>
