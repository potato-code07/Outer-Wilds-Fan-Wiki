    The Hourglass Twins are binary planets orbiting each other. Ember Twin is mostly desert rock divided into two halves by a wide equatorial canyon, and Ash Twin is almost entirely made of sand laid over a black, rocky core. Both planets orbit very closely to the Sun.
    <br><br>
    The twin planets' gravitational pull on each other changes from time to time, resulting in a natural phenomenon where sand is passed from one to the other over the course of about twenty minutes, like an hourglass (hence the name "Hourglass Twins").
    <br><br>
    Two minutes into the game cycle, the Ember Twin will start to pull sand from the Ash Twin. Once the flow of sand stops, the current cycle will soon come to an end.

        The Hourglass Twins are the closest celestial bodies to the Sun (excluding The Interloper at its periapsis and the Sun Station). As they are relatively small planets, gravity is low compared to Timber Hearth, but not as low as that of the Interloper. The Ember twin was likely an ocean world as fossils of aquatic animals and plants exist in the caves and northern lakebed.
